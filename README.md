# Basic Fractals Drawing

This code has the intentions to draw two basic fractals.
- **gosper Flawsnake**
- **Koch Curve**

These are two very basic fractals, this code has the intention
to understand how to generate those fractals, nothing fancy :)

## Usage
This is an eclipse project, open the project using eclipse
to run Gosper Flawsnake just comment out KochCurve line code
from the method `paintComponent`.
To run Koch Curve just comment out Gosper Flawsnake from the same method.

You can zoom in/out, drag the fractal and also I think that you can click
on the window to start drawing the fractal.

**NOTE**
There are some TODO and BUGS to solve :]
